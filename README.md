You will see that there are no comments from when i pushed the files. That is because i pushed to the wrong folder. I am adding them here if you nedd to see them.



**thursday: **
first edition. added html and css file. added assets: images and icons.
ps: made some design changes since last time.
html: put in the major elements for home page: navbar, banner, product-carousel (static), boxes for blog and other, and a footer.
css: started styling most of the elements above.  made menubar (checkbox hack). added color and background image to body. styled product-tiles and made a flexbox for them. haven't finished the flex completely yet. styles boxes for blog and other and made a flexbox for them. may want to revisit this decision later.

**friday:**
fixed flex-items. converted blog-items to grid. focused on making responsive content. added media queries. 

saturday: ps: forgot to push on friday. focused on topnav. fixed some items not behaving as intended. not happy about the menu hack on mobile and tablet, but as it is right now, cant do much else.
